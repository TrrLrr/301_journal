Today's lab assignment was definetly challenging at times, but not quite as difficult as I thought it might be. The jQuery library is pretty easy to get a handle on, outside of a few quirks. There were times that the jQuery implementation was so simple, that I was worried we were doing it wrong, and then pleasantly surprised when it behaved as expected. The trickiest bit was the event delegation, but after reading some documentation, I have a bit firmer grasp on it.
