  Today I learned....

  Today I learned a lot. It was really useful to work with a partner and get used to work flow. Alot of the day was spent trying to style with CSS, which so far has probably been my weakest area, and also the aspect of these classes I haven't focused on as much, so I think it was important to be forced to do that. It was nice to work with SVGs, because they seem like really important resources.
