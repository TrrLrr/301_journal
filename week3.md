Week three of 301 was by far the most challenging week of my time at code fellows so far. It was a large work load just in terms of having to build an entire CRUD app from the ground up, and it was just alot to grapple with figuring out what that even meant. But looking back on it, it was also probably the most enriching week as well. Not only from a strictly eductational place of learning how to code, but also learning how to work with other people. Having has to struggle through that process over the week, I think I now could build the same app in a fraction of the time, and thats pretty exciting.
